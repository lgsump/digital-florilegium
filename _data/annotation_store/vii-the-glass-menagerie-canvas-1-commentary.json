This movement is now seen through the sounds of footsteps, though our imagination takes much more authority in regards to the table itself, the outline of the house, or even where each person is sitting. An interesting aspect of this is that in many parts of the South, where Williams' works are usually in critique or response to, or even just where they happen to be located, the men of the family sit at the ends of tables. How does this change our perception of this family, especially audiences not from the South?",

This creates a very easy argument for critics of digital art and art's digitalization as a complete destruction of Williams' play, however, in light of Williams using what I believe Deleuze to be talking about mentioned in the commentary above, I will now cite Hutcheon again in her belief of this adaptation as a creation of its own as well as an extension of the original. It is quite apparent to us that the creator's of this play would know very well that the original Williams play had these integral conceptual pieces to them, and in their exclusion of them, are highlighting the role of dialogue and conversation through this broadcast.

However, in this broadcast, they decided that he would apologize, even if he sounds like his apology doesn't make him feel better. There seems to be quiet a different level of meaning behind and development of the characters through this, and in some ways it could argue the perversion of Williams' play, but on another hand, it could be an argument for its own authorship and creation.
