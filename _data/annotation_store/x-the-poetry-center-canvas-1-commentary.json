These are important aspects of the poetry that are normally left to the reader's interpretation, with the guidance of structure and imagery by McCullers, but ultimately within the hands of the audience. Some might say that this is, like every other person who has read her poem, just a single interpretation. Once an artist releases their work into the world, it becomes a more collective piece, rather than hers or theirs. Nonetheless, for historians or archivists, this can paint a clearer picture on how she viewed her own work and how her work had changed through scholarly work on it from its origin in her mind.",

For this instance, we are getting an intricate understanding of how Tennessee Williams and Carson McCullers' relationship works, as well as how Williams understands and appreciates McCullers' work. It is interesting to think that with McCullers there, why would she, or the sponsors of the event, want Williams to do the reading. This leads to many different understandings of what is going on, some including the presence of Williams as a publicity stunt in order to raise awareness or attract interest in the event. Nonetheless, there is still insight into how these Southern artists interacted and knew each other, giving us insights to not only their work, not only how they view their work, but how they interacted with each other.",
