1.702067	17.247609	TOM: I have tricks in my pocket, I have things up my sleeve. But I am the opposite of a stage magician. He gives you illusion that has the appearance of truth. I give you truth in the pleasant disguise of illusion.	Transcription	
18.731496	44.493823	TOM: To begin with, I turn bark time. I reverse it to that quaint period, the thirties, when the huge middle class of America was matriculating in a school for the blind. Their eyes had failed them or they had failed their eyes, and so they were having their fingers pressed forcibly down on the fiery Braille alphabet of a dissolving economy.	Transcription	Time
44.710313	67.436679	TOM: In Spain there was revolution. Here there was only shouting and confusion. In Spain there was Guernica. Here there were disturbances of labour, sometimes pretty violent, in otherwise peaceful cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, Saint Louis. . . .This is the social background of the play.	Transcription	
67.707292	156.71889	TOM: The play is memory. Being a memory play, it is dimly lighted, it is sentimental, it is not realistic. In memory everything seems to happen to music. That explains the fiddle in the wings. I am the narrator of the play, and also a character in it. The other characters are my mother Amanda, my sister Laura and a gentleman caller who appears in the final scenes. He is the most realistic character in the play, being an emissary from a world of reality that we were somehow set apart from. But since I have a poet's weakness for symbols, I am using this character also as a symbol; he is the long-delayed but always expected something that we live for. There is a fifth character in the play who doesn't appear except in this larger-thanlife-size photograph over the mantel. This is our father who left us a long time ago.He was a telephone man who fell in love with long distances; he gave up his job with the telephone company and skipped the light fantastic out of town. . . .The last we heard of him was a picture postcard from Mazatlan, on the Pacific coast of Mexico, containing a message of two words - 'Hello - Good-bye!' and no address.I think the rest of the play will explain itself ...

158.28913	161.324927	AMANDA: Tom? Tom?	Transcription	
161.420041	162.799962	TOM: Yes, Mother?	Transcription	
162.817504	165.498473	AMANDA: We can't say grace until you come to the table!	Transcription	
165.621133	166.679072	TOM: I'm coming.	Transcription	
174.92793	179.083025	AMANDA: For these and all thy mercies, God's holy name we praise. You know, Laura, I had the funniest experience in Church last Sunday. The Church was crowded except for one pew way down in front, and in that, was just one little woman. I smiled very sweetly at her and I said, 'Excuse me, but would you mind if I share this pew?' 'I certainly would,' she said, 'This space is rented.' Do you know, that's the first time I ever knew that the Lord rented space.	Transcription	
183.307948	209.741878	AMANDA: Tom, honey, don't push with your fingers. If you have to push with something, the thing to push with is a crust of bread. And chew !chew! Animals have sections in their stomachs which enable them to digest food without mastication, but human beings are supposed to chew their food before they swallow it down. Eat food leisurely, son, and really enjoy it. A well-cooked meal has lots of delicate flavours that have to be held in the mouth for appreciation. So chew your food and give your salivary glands a chance to function!	Transcription	
210.375705	242.553806	TOM: Mother, I haven't enjoyed one bite of this dinner because of your constant directions on how to eat it. It's you that makes me rush through meals with your hawk-like attention to every bite I take. Sickening - spoils my appetite - all this discussion of - animals' secretion - salivary glands - mastication!	Transcription	
242.789829	261.139997	AMANDA: Temperament like a Metropolitan star! You're not excused from the table.	Transcription	
261.243539	266.188468	TOM: I'm getting a cigarette.	Transcription	
266.443972	267.593739	AMANDA: You smoke too much.	Transcription	
267.721491	268.679631	LAURA: I'll bring in the coffee.	Transcription	
268.791414	270.514148	AMANDA: No, sister, no, sister - you be the lady this time and I'll be the darkey.	Transcription	
270.646567	273.332792	LAURA: I'm already up.	Transcription	
273.389543	274.316479	AMANDA: Resume your seat, little sister, I want you to stay fresh and pretty for gentleman callers!	Transcription	
274.392148	279.93485	LAURA: I'm not expecting any gentleman callers.	Transcription	
280.161855	282.318401	AMANDA: Sometimes they come when they are least expected! Why, I remember one Sunday afternoon in Blue Mountain -	Transcription	
282.450821	289.923065	TOM: I know what's coming.	Transcription	
290.139051	291.631716	LAURA: Yes. But let her tell it. She loves to tell it.	Transcription	
291.691359	296.582032	AMANDA: One Sunday afternoon in Blue Mountain, your mother received seventeen! gentlemen callers! Why, sometimes there weren't chairs enough to accommodate them all. We had to send the colored boy over to bring in folding chairs from the parish house.	Transcription	
296.641674	311.358843	TOM: How did you entertain those gentleman callers?	Transcription	
311.832363	314.225402	AMANDA: I understood the art of conversation!	Transcription	
314.328885	316.825407	TOM: I bet you could talk.	Transcription	
317.006501	318.325907	AMANDA: Girls in those days knew how to talk, I can tell you.	Transcription	
318.403519	335.909991	AMANDA: They knew how to entertain their gentlemen callers. It wasn't enough for a girl to be possessed of a pretty face and a graceful figure although I wasn't slighted in either respect. She also needed to have a nimble wit and a tongue to meet all occasions.	Transcription	
336.117702	337.571678	TOM: What did you talk about?	Transcription	
337.779388	343.096786	AMANDA: Things of importance going on in the world ! Never anything coarse or common or vulgar.	Transcription	
343.346039	353.814666	AMANDA: My callers were gentleman -all! Among my callers were some of the most prominent young planters of the Mississippi Delta - planters and sons of planters!	Transcription	
354.063919	370.310989	AMANDA: There was young Champ Laughlin who later became vice-president of the Delta Planters Bank. Hadley Stevenson who was drowned in Moon Lake and left his widow one hundred and fifty thousand in Government bonds.	Transcription	
370.774312	412.473391	AMANDA: There were the Cutrere brothers, Wesley and Bates. Bates was one of my bright particular beaux! He got in a quarrel with that wild Wainwright boy. They shot it out on the floor of Moon Lake Casino. Bates was shot through the stomach. Died in the ambulance on his way to Memphis. His widow was also well provided for, came into eight or ten thousand acres, that's all. She married him on the rebound - never loved her - carried my picture on him the night he died !And there was that boy that every girl in the Delta had set her cap for! That beautiful, brilliant young Fitzhugh boy from Greene County!	Transcription	
412.625048	413.678094	TOM: What did he leave his widow?	Transcription	
413.987814	419.748596	AMANDA: He never married ! Gracious, you talk as though all of my old admirers had turned up their toes to the daisies !	Transcription	
419.903456	422.329763	TOM: Isn't this the first you've mentioned that still survives ?	Transcription	
422.477416	443.793803	AMANDA: That Fitzhugh boy went North and made a fortune - came to be known as the Wolf of Wall Street! He had the Midas touch, whatever he touched turned to gold! And I could have been Mrs Duncan J. Fitzhugh, mind you! But what did I do- I just went out of my way and picked your father !	Transcription	
443.937078	445.274308	LAURA: Mother, let me clear the table.	Transcription	
445.417582	459.175904	AMANDA: No, dear, you go in front and study your typewriter chart. Or practise your shorthand a little. Stay fresh and pretty! It's almost time for our gentlemen callers to start arriving. How many do you suppose we're going to entertain this afternoon?	Transcription	
459.494062	462.009869	LAURA: I don't believe we're going to receive any, Mother.	Transcription	
462.082288	466.540558	AMANDA: What? Not one - not one? You must be joking!	Transcription	
466.582809	473.850007	AMANDA: Not one gentleman caller? It can't be true ! There must be a flood, there must have been a tornado!	Transcription	
474.145765	487.528813	LAURA: It isn't a flood, it's not a tornado, Mother. I'm just not popular like you were in Blue Mountain. ... Mother's afraid I'm going to be an old maid.	Transcription	
530.478655	533.483699	LAURA: Hello, Mother, I was - 	Transcription	
533.837233	538.60995	AMANDA: Deception ? Deception ?	Transcription	
542.763982	557.000637	LAURA: How was the DAR. meeting? Didn't you go to the DAR. meeting, Mother?	Transcription	
557.412925	574.976379	AMANDA [faintly, almost inaudibly]: - No. - No. I did not have the strength - to go to the DAR. In fact, I did not have the courage! I wanted to find a hole in the ground and hide myself in it for ever ! 	Transcription	
579.429086	583.282871	LAURA: Why did you do that, Mother? Why are you ??	Transcription	
583.511355	589.360528	AMANDA: Why? Why? How old are you, Laura?	Transcription	
589.589011	591.416877	LAURA: Mother, you know my age.	Transcription	
591.691057	600.54554	AMANDA: I thought that you were an adult; it seems that I was mistaken. 	Transcription	
600.728326	605.206599	LAURA: Please don't stare at me, Mother.	Transcription	
605.709263	613.020729	AMANDA: What are we going to do, what is going to become of us, what is the future?	Transcription	
614.0488	622.144435	LAURA: Has something happened, Mother?  Mother, has - something happened?	Transcription	
622.870957	630.862691	AMANDA: I'll be all right in a minute, I'm just bewildered  - by life. ...	Transcription	
631.1533	634.301559	LAURA: Mother, I wish that you would tell me what's happened!	Transcription	
635.560862	651.302158	AMANDA: As you know, I was supposed to be inducted into my office at the D.A.R. this afternoon.  But I stopped off at Rubicam's business college to speak to your teachers about your having a cold and ask them what progress they thought you were making down there.	Transcription	
651.544332	652.419277	LAURA: Oh....	Transcription	
652.707231	755.689744	AMANDA: I went to the typing instructor and introduced myself as your mother. She didn't know who you were. Wingfield, she said. We don't have any such student enrolled at the school! I assured her she did, that you had been going to classes since early in January. 'I wonder,' she said, 'if you could be talking about that terribly shy little girl who dropped out of school after only a few days' attendance?' 'No,' I said, 'Laura, my daughter, has been going to school every day for the past six weeks !' 'Excuse me,' she said. She took the attendance book out and there was your name, unmistakably printed, and all the dates you were absent until they decided that you had dropped out of school. I still said, 'No, there must have been some mistake I There must have been some mix-up in the records !' And she said, 'No - I remember her perfectly now. Her hands shook so that she couldn't hit the right keys ! The first time we gave a speed-test, she broke down completely - was sick at the stomach and almost had to be carried into the wash-room! After that morning she never showed up any more. We phoned the house but never got any answer' -while I was working at Famous and Barr, I suppose, demonstrating those - Oh! I felt so weak I could barely keep on my feet ! I had to sit down while they got me a glass of water ! Fifty dollars' tuition, all of our plans - my hopes and ambition for you - just gone up the spout, just gone up the spout like that. Oh, don't do that, Laura, don't play that victrola. 	Transcription	
755.81874	757.882668	LAURA: Oh I 	Transcription	
761.521474	766.293448	AMANDA: Laura? Laura, where have you been going when you've gone on pretending that you were going to business college ?	Transcription	
766.540559	767.899669	LAURA: I've just been going out walking.	Transcription	
768.308412	769.726578	AMANDA: That's not true.	Transcription	
769.895408	773.609652	LAURA: It is. I just went walking.	Transcription	
773.879779	784.443128	AMANDA: Walking? Walking? In winter? Deliberately courting pneumonia in that light coat? Where did you walk to, Laura?	Transcription	
784.695777	789.888583	LAURA: All sorts of places - mostly in the park.	Transcription	
790.070787	792.894945	AMANDA: Even after you'd started catching that cold?	Transcription	
793.077149	801.553093	LAURA: It was the lesser of two evils, Mother. I couldn't go back up. I threw up -on the floor !	Transcription	
801.866238	810.69634	AMANDA: From half past seven till after five every day you mean to tell me you walked around in the park, because you wanted to make me think that you were still going to Rubicam's Business College?	Transcription	
810.884445	816.113773	LAURA: It wasn't as bad as it sounds. I went inside places to get warmed up	Transcription	
816.236919	817.375045	AMANDA: Inside where?	Transcription	
817.575891	839.702181	LAURA: I went in the art museum and the bird-houses at the Zoo. I visited the penguins every day! Sometimes I did without lunch and went to the movies. Lately I've been spending most of my afternoons in the jewel-box, that big glass-house where they raise the tropical flowers.	Transcription	
840.116013	844.86082	AMANDA: You did all this to deceive me, just for deception? Why?	Transcription	
845.193783	853.18497	LAURA: Mother, when you're disappointed, you get that awful suffering look on your face, like the picture of Jesus' mother in the museum !	Transcription	
853.267666	853.929702	AMANDA: Hush !	Transcription	
854.064834	855.353405	LAURA: I couldn't face it.	Transcription	
859.795585	947.231093	AMANDA: So what are we going to do the rest of our lives? Stay home and watch the parades go by? Amuse ourselves with the glass menagerie, darling? Eternally play those worn-out phonograph records your father left as a painful reminder of him? We won't have a business career - we've given that up because it gave us nervous indigestion ! What is there left but dependency all our lives? I know so well what becomes of unmarried women who aren't prepared to occupy a position. I've seen such pitiful cases in the South - barely tolerated spinsters living upon the grudging patronage of sister's husband or brother's wife ! - stuck away in some little mousetrap of a room - encouraged by one in-law to visit another - little birdlike women without any nest - eating the crust of humility all their life ! Is that the future that we've mapped out for ourselves? I swear it's the only alternative I can think of ! It isn't a very pleasant alternative, is it? Of course - some girls do marry! Haven't you ever liked some boy?	Transcription	
947.919604	953.173106	LAURA: Yes. I liked one once. I came across his picture a while ago.	Transcription	
953.358393	954.692875	AMANDA: He gave you his picture?	Transcription	
954.791725	956.398045	LAURA: No, it's in the year-book.	Transcription	
956.447471	958.177354	AMANDA: Oh - a high-school boy.	Transcription	
958.300917	967.073897	LAURA: Yes. His name was Jim. Here he is in The Pirates of Penzance.	Transcription	
967.296311	968.000853	AMANDA: The what?	Transcription	
968.149387	984.903522	LAURA: The operetta the senior class put on. He had a wonderful voice and we sat across the aisle from each other Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the Aud. Here he is with the silver cup for debating !See his grin?	Transcription	
985.32519	987.43353	AMANDA: He must have had a jolly disposition.	Transcription	
988.843471	992.125778	LAURA: He used to call me - Blue Roses.	Transcription	
992.419629	994.423161	AMANDA: Why did he call you such a name as that?	Transcription	
994.636871	1037.227469	LAURA: When I had that attack of pleurosis - he asked me what was the matter when I came back. I Said pleurosis he thought that I said Blue Roses ! So that's what he always called me after that. Whenever he saw me, he'd holler, 'Hello, Blue Roses ! I didn't care for the girl that he went out with. Emily Meisenbach. Emily was the best-dressed girl at school. She never struck me, though, as being sincere. . . . It says in the Personal Section - they're engaged. That's a long time ago. They must be married by now.	Transcription	
1037.600818	1046.971369	AMANDA: Girls that aren't cut out for business careers usually wind up married to some nice man. Sister, that's what you'll do !	Transcription	
1048.103062	1048.949671	LAURA: But, Mother	Transcription	
1049.016572	1049.76931	AMANDA: Yes ? 	Transcription	
1050.607386	1052.479543	LAURA: I'm - crippled !	Transcription	
1052.561443	1078.764844	AMANDA: Nonsense ! Laura, I've told you never, never to use that word. Why, you're not crippled, you just have a little defect - hardly noticeable, even! When people have some slight disadvantage like that, they cultivate other things to make up for it - develop charm - and vivacity and - charm! That's all you have to do ! One thing your father had plenty of - was charm!	Transcription	
1099.338967	1119.936237	TOM: After the fiasco at Rubicam's Business College, the idea of getting a gentleman caller for Laura began to play a more and more important part in Mother's calculations. It became an obsession. Like some archetype of the universal unconscious, the image of the gentleman caller haunted our small apartment. ...	Transcription	
1120.534498	1175.962735	TOM: Even when he wasn't mentioned, his presence hung in Mother's preoccupied look and in my sister's frightened, apologetic manner - hung like a sentence passed upon the Wingfields ! Mother was a woman of action as well as words. She began to take logical steps in the planned direction. Late that winter and in the early spring - realizing that extra money would be needed to properly feather the nest and plume the bird - she conducted a vigorous campaign on the- telephone, roping in subscribers to one of those magazines for matrons called The Home-maker's Companion, the type of journal that features the serialized , sublimations of ladies of letters who think in terms of eyes like wood-smoke in autumn, fingers that soothe and caress like strains of music, bodies as powerful as Etruscan sculpture.	Transcription	
1177.826985	1250.017853	AMANDA: Ida Scott? This is Amanda Wingfield! We missed you at the D.A.R. meeting last Monday! I said to myself: She's probably suffering with that sinus condition ! How is that sinus condition? Horrors ! Heaven have mercy !- You're a Christian martyr, yes, that's what you are, a Christian martyr ! Well, I just have happened to notice that your subscription to the Companion's about to expire! Yes, it expires with the next issue, honey !- just when that wonderful new serial by Bessie Mae Hopper is getting off to such an exciting start. Oh, honey, it's something that you can't miss !You remember how 'Gone With the Wind' took everybody by storm? You simply couldn't go out if you hadn't read it. All everybody talked was Scarlet O'Hara. Well, this is a book that critics already compare to Gone With the Wind. It's the 'Gone With the Wind' of the post-World War generation! - What? -Burning !- Oh, honey, don't let them burn, go take a look in the oven and I'll hold- Heavens - I think she's hung up ! ... Oh, Tom! Tom, do you know what she did? She hung up on me. 	Transcription	
1250.118766	1253.521002	LAURA: Mother, Mother! Tom's trying to write!	Transcription	
1253.618992	1260.77231	AMANDA: Oh? So he is... So he is! Why can't you sit up straight?	Transcription

1265.141261	1271.182793	AMANDA: Now, I've seen a medical chart. And I know what that position does to your internal organs! Now you sit up and I'll shoo!	Transcription

0.2	0.6	<font color="green">An important thing to keep in mind is that the original play by Tennessee Williams <i>The Glass Menagerie</i> premiered in Chicago in 1944 was intended to be performed on stage with a live and physical audience. As the speech begins, it is important to recognize that now, sound is the only sense that we are given, so something that was both auditory and visual is now constrained to just audio.	Commentary	Transformation
159	160	<font color="green">Here is the first line beyond the perfect transcription of the introduction by Tom, and we already see how, in performance, actors often make many changes to their lines through improvisation, poor memory, or other factors. There is already a question of translation from audio-visual to plainly audio like mentioned before, but now we have to also pay attention to the fact that versions of the play, even if performed on radio with script, can be adapted and changed by the creators of the performance or the actors themselves.	Commentary	Transformation
166	167	<font color="green">This is another example of a change, as the original play had the word "Coming, Mother" as well as an indicator of the movement of the actor that states "He bows slightly and withdraws, a few moments later in his place at the table". This movement is now seen through the sounds of footsteps, though our imagination takes much more authority in regards to the table itself, the outline of the house, or even where each person is sitting. An interesting aspect of this is that in many parts of the South, where Williams' works are usually in critique or response to, or even just where they happen to be located, the men of the family sit at the ends of tables. How does this change our perception of this family, especially audiences not from the South?	Commentary	Transformation
175	184	<font color="green">Here we have a complete addition to the play, as the transcription above is not found in the original screenplay. This emphasizes the creators of this performance feeling as though it is necessary to perhaps make up for the lack of visual components of the play and to fluff it with more conversation. This also adds a layer of that Southern feeling that was lost with my earlier comment on the table ettiquette. 	Commentary	Transformation
186	189	<font color="green">We can also hear the clanking of the forks to allow our imaginations authorship. This point reminds me of Linda Hutcheon's discussion of how sometimes these adaptations are intended to be consumed with their originals in mind. This can complicate many things, especially like additions we saw right before because if this was truly intended to have your memory of watching the physical play, why not get more vague or mystical instead of more specific?	Commentary	Transformation
68	70	<font color="green">A memory play is what Tennessee Williams describes as how he is intending on being closer to truth through his art. He believes that the "photographic likeness" of the realistic plays emphasize what is unimportant in art: truth. So, this play is meant to be like the narrator's memory of these events, which is also why it happens to be semi-autobiographical. Williams is a character, narrator, director, and writer through himself and Tom. 	Commentary	Time
269	270	<font color="green">Due to its time and place, there are also sentiments of racism within the play. In some renditions of the script there also includes more derogatory language towards Black people. 	Commentary	Transformation
211	212	<font color="green">We can hear the silverware hit the plate, but an interesting note in the original script is that the fork is called imaginary. This could mean many things, considering the scene itself is technically imaginary according to Tom as it is a memory, but it could also be an interpretation, as other points in the script there aren't strict distinctions like saying Tom sits at the <i>imaginary</i> table. 	Commentary	Transformation
243	245	<font color="green">Another example of how the use of sound to indicate movement.	Commentary	Transformation
281	282	<font color="green">Amanda leaving the room is indicated through her disappearing voice. It would've made Tom and Laura's conversation awkward if the audience assumed that Amanda was in the same room. 	Commentary	Transformation
285	286	<font color="green">Another change of words in the updated version due to the intensity of racist language used. How can this transformation of art into the digital or virtual world also be an attempt to erase their problematic past?	Commentary	Transformation
318.35	320	<font color="green">Between the above and below lines, the original play also had an image of Amanda as a young girl greeting those callers, but this was obviously much harder for the radio broadcast to include, so they either had hoped that the reference did enough work or relied heavily on Hutcheon's idea that the audience would be merely extending their understanding of the play from their previous interaction with it.	Commentary	Transformation
339	341	<font color="green">This is the beginning of the omission of a very integral idea that Williams had in mind in his vision for the play. The play itself played with reality and time as an attempt to uncover truth. To me, this reminds me of Gilles Deleuze on the Crystal-Image, as we were meant to envision a seemingly crystalized version of Tom's memory in an attempt to fully understand the concept that Williams was attempting to convey. 	Commentary	Time
339.2	342	<font color="green">Within this scene, Tom is meant to be reading the script of the play and pointing the crew to change the lights and highlight Amanda's place in the scene. However, we are only able to hear the conversation that Amanda and Tom are having together. This creates a very easy argument for critics of digital art and art's digitalization as a complete destruction of Williams' play, however, in light of Williams using what I believe Deleuze to be talking about mentioned in the commentary above, I will now cite Hutcheon again in her belief of this adaptation as a creation of its own as well as an extension of the original. It is quite apparent to us that the creator's of this play would know very well that the original Williams play had these integral conceptual pieces to them, and in their exclusion of them, are highlighting the role of dialogue and conversation through this broadcast. This allows us to see the masterworking of dialogue that Williams created <i>on top</i> of these visual or conceptual scenes of the original. 	Commentary	Transformation
466.56	468	<font color="green">Within the original script, there was a note here to show Laura going off to the portiere and having a bright light shine on her, but it was left out and Amanda's next line was smushed into her previous one. 	Commentary	Transformation
613.9	615	<font color="green">There was supposed to be a count of ten between the line above and below me, so there is also a question of how art through its digitalization can also be victim to the growing perils of money and bureaucracy. 	Commentary	Transformation
758	760	<font color="green">The last sentence of Amanda's line above that ends in "don't play that victrola" were additions made by the actress, Jessica Tandy, and is an example of the difference between this act of individuality by the actor in radio versions of the play versus the original. In the radio version, it can be either prerecorded and edited to be very intentional through this addition, which would be very different than original renditions of the play on, say, Broadway, or they can be in the rush of the moment, which would be very similar to the reality of acting in a play like the original. 	Commentary	Transformation
795	800	<font color="green">In the middle of Laura's line above, there was originally meant to be another image displayed that depicted Laura in the park. This ability to use imagery within the original play, again, being lost. 	Commentary	Transformation
795.2	800	<font color="green">This also removed a certain atmosphere for the chaotic and broken style of production that Williams was intending through the memory play. I would also be curious to see how Deleuze would view these images. As they remind me of his understanding of montage and part of the Movement-Image.	Commentary	Time
856	859	<font color="green">In between the above and below lines, in the original there were notes for a legend that writes "the crust of humility."	Commentary	Transformation
958.2	960	<font color="green">The image of "Jim as a high-school hero bearing a silver cup" was meant to display.	Commentary	Transformation
992.2	994	<font color="green">An image of blue roses appeared in the original play in between the above and below lines. 	Commentary	Transformation
992.3	994	<font color="green">This image is a bit different from the others as it completely shows us the visual of a blue roses, even though the reality of blue roses was that it was a misinterpretation of her iIlness. This can play into some of Williams' ideas of how memory works and how imagery plays a role in memory. The question to me becomes is the imagery for the audience to have this visual battle in their minds before they realize why he really calls her Blue Roses or is it more to represent how he visualizes it when remembering?	Commentary	Time
1079	1081	<font color="green">What is left out from the original, again, in the same way an omission of the control that Tom has in his memory play, was that Tom was meant to wave to the fiddle to sign that it was time to play. 	Commentary	Transformation
1117	1118	<font color="green">Image of the young man was also meant to be shown during this monologue. 	Commentary	Transformation
1117.2	1119	<font color="green">Giving us a better idea about how this image is still, as he continues to say, haunting him in this memory. This allows us to make a better decision about the earlier images including that of the Blue Roses.	Commentary	Time
1245	1247	<font color="green">This is an example of how digitalization of these processes can also result in errors or mistakes, as you can hear her sentence being cut off. She was meant to say "I'll hold the wire." Just like in this project, having so many external factors can make it hard to tune out every issue and curate everything perfectly. This is another argument seen against the digitalization of great artworks; it's just too much work!	Commentary	Transformation
1271.2	1273	<font color="green">Before we see Tom speak, there is a note in the original Broadway script that mentions that there was meant to be a light shining on Laura throughout this scene that seems to highlight how when Tom remembers this experience, he continues to focus on how Laura reacts or feels. 	Commentary	Time
1271.201	1273	<font color="green">This note was not referenced or made-up immediately after in the radio broadcasting.	Commentary	Transformation
1253.53	1254	<font color="green">The line above and below are not included in the original script, and seems to be making up for the fact that, in the original, there was faint arguing between Tom and Amanda that starts the scene off, whereas in a couple of seconds is when the argument emerges for this version.	Commentary	Transformation
1308	1310	<font color="green">The radio broadcast also chose to change the language from "house, house!" to "My house, my house!" to emphasize the point, even though the rest of the line about questioning who pays the rent was still in the original. 	Commentary	Transformation
1321.123	1323	<font color="green">In the original, there is also a production note that says that the upstate area is "lit with a turgid smokey red glow" to resemble the growing anger and exemplify it through the poetic imagination of Tom's memory. 	Commentary	Time
1321.1234	1323	<font color="green">There is also an included note about Amanda's appearance in Mr. Wingfeild's clothes, as well as how both Amanda's and Tom's shadows appear projected onto the ceiling in the fiery glow. 	Commentary	Transformation
1425	1428	<font color="green">When mentioning him, there is an integral piece of visual information that the original play and script had that isn't possible through this radio broadcast: Tom pointing at his father on the mantle. It is implied in some ways, if you can remember that Mr. Wingfield is on the mantle and that he had died, but other that, it is requiring a good amount of context clues. 	Commentary	Transformation
1426	1428	<font color="green">Whether or not this was intentional is worth looking into, but again could be connected to Hutcheon's idea of already knowing the story. Having it in your memory as well.	Commentary	Time
1494	1495	<font color="green">In the original, there was meant to be moments after he calls Amanda a witch where he stumbles and ultimately hits the glass menagerie, but as you can hear, he hits and breaks the glass menagerie before he even calls her a witch. This seems to be an intentional change and time-saving effort of the radio broadcast to make the scene and communication of the broken glass efficient to people listening on the radio.	Commentary	Transformation
1508.02	1510	<font color="green">One of the most interesting changes we see in this adaptation of the play is that Tom is originally supposed to be stunned stupidly by his mistake in destroying Laura's glass menagerie, and the script mentions that he looks at Laura as if to speak, yet he couldn't. However, in this broadcast, they decided that he would apologize, even if he sounds like his apology doesn't make him feel better. There seems to be quiet a different level of meaning behind and development of the characters through this, and in some ways it could argue the perversion of Williams' play, but on another hand, it could be an argument for its own authorship and creation.
