<h2><center>Conclusion</center>
<br>
<h4>Through the film, a radio play, and a transformation from poetry to music and video, this project has evaluated different aspects of film and literary theory and philosophy of art to review the authenticity of these digital artworks. As we have seen, the discussion of time and movement in these digitalized artworks, especially when there is a use of video or audio, becomes at the forefront to their defense as true art. Time and time again we have seen the discussion of these translations and transformations how they have perverted or destroyed the beauty found in earlier art forms like literature or song. The development of technology has allowed the world of artists to grow and develop in many unprecedented ways, many of them present in the collection here. Being able to scroll through an audio recording of a play, having removed the visual aspect of watching a play, can completely change how an audience interacts and feels during the performance. These questions have been evaluated and presented in a perspective of creation and interpretation that we see in both Deleuze and Hutcheon.</h4>

<h4>Ultimately, the struggle for defending digital authenticity in art will continue to be a battle, but through their presentation and use by digital humanists like myself, we can continue to provide these digital presentations of these artworks in an attempt to provide the audience with a holistic aesthetic or emotional experience as well as the individual ones experienced with the independent artworks themselves. My goal was to present this florilegium as an analogy for one of the most important aspects of these pieces and a main pillar in the structure of digital art: timelessness.</h4>

<h4>There seems to be something deeply personal about how we interact with art, and that is no excuse for our experiences with art virtually. Like Deleuze mentioned, the bridge between the virtual and the real can be turned into a new and beautiful experience of its own, one never seen with the works of literature or song, one that crystalizes and invents a way of experiencing; a creation that transcends the natural world but lives in synchronicity with it. I’d like to finish off with a quote from Tennessee Williams on this act of transformation, even in spite of his own personal views of how he initially would interpret some of these newer mediums of art due to the rise of technology:</h4>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>“Everyone should know nowadays the unimportance of the photographic in art: that truth, life, or reality is an organic thing which the poetic imagination can represent or suggest, in essence, only through transformation, through changing into other forms than those which were merely present in appearance.”</blockquote>
