  <h4>Released as a poem in <i>Derek Jarman's Garden</i> (1995), a book by Derek Jarman, was then turned into a song in the album <i>Translucence</i> by Donna McKevitt in 2004. Five years later in 2009, Chris Briggs takes the song and makes a visual experience to go along with it. These annotations will provide you with the ability to compare and contrast the changes made in between the different mediums. My commentary will then discuss how these changes can aid, or sometimes call for concern, the original essence of the art. However, an atmosphere of creation and the extension of the original concepts allows for the adaptations to not only have their own beauty, but also enhance and remind us of the original's aesthetic value. The colors represent the actual transcription of the original poem in <font color="red">red</font>, the lyrics of Donna McKevitt's song in <font color="blue">blue</font>, and the words that appear on screen in Briggs' video in <font color="green">green</font>.
