  <h4><i>The Glass Menagerie</i> by Tennessee Williams. This adaptation of the 1945 play, including scenes 1, 2, and 3. It is performed and narrated by Montgomery Clift as Tom. Julie Harris plays Laura, Jessica Tandy as Amanda, and David Wayne as Jim. Directed by Howard Sackler for Caedmon Records. Supported by The Theatre Recording Society and produced in 1964. This piece will include the transcription, to the best of my abilities, and commentary, which is labeled in <font color="green">green</font>. The transcription of the play's timestamps are going to be a little bit off, but overall the purpose for them is more to be in the general area as well as letting the viewer have the words in front of them as well as through the audio. The purpose of this piece will be to provide an example of an adaptation that exercises its transformation through digitalization as well as becomes a creation of its own.
