  <h4>This recording is an excerpt from a program at The Poetry Center, YMHA, New York in 1954. She speaks about her experiences in Paris, her poetry, and her book <i>My Heart is a Lonely Hunter</i>. This is the first tape of three found at the Harry Ransom Center Digital Collections. The link is at the bottom of the page, under the annotations. Most of the annotations are transcription, but my commentary is highlighted through <font color="green">green</font> text.
