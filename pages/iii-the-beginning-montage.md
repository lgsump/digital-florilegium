<h4><i>Arrival</i> (2016) is a film directed by Denis Villeneuve for Paramount Pictures. Starring Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks and Jeremy Renner as Dr. Ian Donnelly, this sci-fi film navigates the role of language in our understanding of concepts like time and its connection to how we derive meaning. An adaptation itself from the novella by Ted Chiang titled <i>Story of Your Life</i> (1998), I present below the beginning montage of the film. Keep in mind what was presented in Chapter II about Deleuze, and I will attempt to guide you through this montage as an example for how digital art like film transform time itself to defend its claim as a true form of art.
