  <h4>As a continuation of <i>Arrival</i>, we will now view the ending montage of the film. What's important to know for this is that Dr. Louise Banks has finally learned the big question of the aliens' arrival: What is your purpose on Earth? Because of this and all her research on their language, she learns that it is not a weapon they bring like many believed, but a tool; their tool and gift is their language, which allows them to see their life holistically from start to finish. Many believe part of the meaning of life comes from its temporality and uncertainty, but this film argues the opposite... sort of.</h4>
