<h4>The inclusion of these collections is for a visual purpose to bring to light and refresh your memory on how the theme of transformation has been present in each of the digital artworks. Also, as a note, the code for this page has not been completed yet and is under progress. So, even though you won't be able to skim through the different audios or videos, you will still have the collection of annotations to serve as a holistic perspective on the role of this theme throughout the project. </h4>
