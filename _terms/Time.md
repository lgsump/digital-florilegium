<h4>Below is all the annotations that are linked to the theme of time throughout the different examples. Unfortunately, the code for the ability to listen/watch all of the media together on this page is still in progress. However, this page can still act as a experience bank and visual picture of how each piece we've looked at regards to this theme after going through it all. </h4>
